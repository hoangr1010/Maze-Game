Game Plan

Game name: MAZE RUN

BASIC IDEA: 
- Multiple maze levels the player will have to navigate through. Maybe there will be monsters(OR TRAPS) or enemies the player will have to avoid or defeat. Items could be tools to help evade or defeat monsters. Things such as a health potion.  Goal of the game is to reach the end of the maze.
Enemies could move on a fixed path or if we have enough time the enemies could chase the player around the maze. 
Traps can be coded as a monster object with a lot of health

ITEMS:
- Sword to defeat monsters
	Press the SPACE key
	Prints a character for the sword and then erases a 1 second or so after. Flicker sword on screen. 
- Health potion to restore health
	Press Q
	Increase health counter

OBJECTS:
- Table: T
- Rug: [] 
- Bed: |---| - This object could restore health
- Door: | or _
	Travel between levels
	Start door: red
	Exit door: green
